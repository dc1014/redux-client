# PURE COMPONENTS

Using Redux and Immutable, everything can be written as Pure Components (also 'dump components'). Similar to pure functions, these have the following rules:

- A pure component receives all its data as props, like a function receives all its data as arguments. No side effects, including reading data from anywhere else, network requests, etc.

- Generally, has no internal state. What it renders is fully driven by its input props. Same component with same props should be same UI. No hidden state to make them different.

## SIMILARITY

Similar to pure function, we know what a component does by looking at its input and its rendered output.

The state resides in an immutable data structure inside the Store.

React components are a stateless projection of the state at a given point in time.
